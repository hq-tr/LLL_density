# Guiding center orbits on the LLL

A small routine that plots the density of the single-particle states on the lowest Landau level (LLL). A visualization tool for introductory tutorials on the guiding center orbits on the LLL.

The state on the disk is parametrized by a single quantum number m, while the state on the sphere is parametrized by the total spin S and the L_z quantum number M.

Given a list of m (specified in the variable m_list), for each value of m the corresponding state on the disk, psi_m, and on the sphere psi_(S,M=S-m) is plotted.
